# Temp file cleaner

This script, is being developed, so companies, don't have to worry about going to a computer, and check the following things:

- Task manager:
    - Cpu utilization
    - Memory utilization
- General computer specs

# üìÉ To-do: 
    [] Getting information about CPU temperature
# üõ†Ô∏è Working on:
    [] Auto updating;

# ‚úÖ Done: 
    [] Getting information about the disks


# Configurations
- Create a webhook
- Go into config.ini file and assign the values, (inside the file there's an explanation about every setting)
- Download all the packages using `npm install`, use `npm build` to make an executable with nexe. (Caution: Some antivirus will flag it has virus. Why? You may ask. Response: It removes OS folders, specifically temporary folders: ["temp", "%temp%", "prefetch"], so don't worry!)
- Optional:
    - Go to task scheduler: 
    - Click on: "Create Task"
    - Name the task something knowledgeable: e.g. "Monitor computer task"
    - Click on the "Triggers" tab
    - Use the default: "On schedule"
    - Change the start hour, so you are sure that on that time someone is using the computer, (if you want, use: "Repeat task every:", so the task will run itself). Click OK
    - Then go to "Actions" tab, click on "New", leave everything as default, just change on: "Program / script" to the .exe file directory
    - Then click "OK"
    - Then click "OK" again and close task manager (The program should run on the defined schedule)## Pre-requisites:
- Recommended having a discord server, to receive the data;   
- Then you are going to receive the data to the discord!
